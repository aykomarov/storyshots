Storybook imports ts configurations via https://github.com/egoist/esbuild-register
Manager build file:///D:/storyshots/node_modules/@storybook/builder-manager/dist/index.js
Files are compiled using https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#build-scripts
Preview build file:///D:/storyshots/node_modules/@storybook/builder-webpack5/dist/index.js
Template at D:\storyshots\node_modules\@storybook\builder-webpack5\templates\preview.ejs
Stories generated on index.json route at file:///D:/storyshots/node_modules/@storybook/core-server/dist/index.js
    They are selected using glob matcher https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/aadef511b3ceaeae939e7d5998350e9481e6dbf0/code/lib/core-server/src/utils/StoryIndexGenerator.ts#L133
    Then, ast content of each file is parsed using https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/aadef511b3ceaeae939e7d5998350e9481e6dbf0/code/lib/csf-tools/src/CsfFile.ts#L138
    After these steps, stories json file is generated and sent back to the client
importFn imports csf stories as separate chunks

Content is dynamically built using VirtualModulesPlugin (entry.js contains generated entry)
Why hot reload works in that way?
